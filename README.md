# Search Algorithms Visualizer

## Description
This project is a visualizer for various searching algorithms implemented using the Pygame module. It allows users to interactively explore and understand the following searching algorithms:

- Depth-First Search (DFS)
- Breadth-First Search (BFS)
- Uniform Cost Search (UCS)
- Dijkstra's Algorithm
- A* Search Algorithm

The visualizer provides a graphical representation of how each algorithm traverses through a grid to find the shortest path from a start node to a goal node.
